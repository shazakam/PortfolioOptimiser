# Portfolio Optimisation Project

Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio optimisation project. Currently only works for Oslo Stock Exchange but more european exchanges will be added.
Consists for three primary pages:
    1. Data Loading Page: Loads in data from selected marketes given desired time period
    2. Metric filtering: From the market data, for every stock extract fundamental metrics such as PE, PB, Current Ratio and display with a couple of histograms
    3. Model Page: Select the equities desired to be placed in your final portfolio. Then select the Portfolio optimisation model.

## TODO:
- [X] Allow for multiple markets, not just OSBX
- [ ] Optimisation of Sharpe ratios instead of mean-variance 
- [ ] Add individual stock analysis page i.e. Load in ticker and calculate whether it is undervalued or not according to certain metrics / fundamental stats - Growth, Earnings, Stability and Assets
- [ ] Crypto Dashboard?
